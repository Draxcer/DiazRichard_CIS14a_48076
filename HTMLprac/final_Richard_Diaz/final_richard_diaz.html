	<h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> My name is Richard Diaz. I am a 20 year old male. Around other places I go by my normal username "Draxcer". You can see some of my gaming on my YouTube Channel by clicking <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Draxcer">here</a> or by click my logo on the top of this page.</p>
    <p> Since I was a kid I was always interested in computers. Even building my first computer when I was 10. And since then have been upgrading that same computer in many ways. And as years go by I am finding myself to be interested in more and more things.</p>

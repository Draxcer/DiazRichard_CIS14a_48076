<p> Starting a few months ago I got into a hobby known as <i>Cardistry</i> or also known as <i>Card Flourishing</i>. "Card flourishes are visual displays of skill performed with playing cards, designed to show the skill or manual dexterity of a 'flourisher'. Card flourishes are primarily intended to be visually impressive and to appear difficult to do."<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_flourish">[1]</a></sup></p>

	<h2> Cycling </h2>
    <img src="cycling.gif" />
    <p> A few years back after my family split apart and I moved, I bought my self a bike. I haven't ridden a bike since I was a kid, but I wanted one to start commuting to school and to work as a means to save gas. But once I started, I loved it. "Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances."<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling">[2]</a></sup> But Cycling became another part of me that has developed into more than just commuting. The feeling of going fast through my own power made me feel enlightened and I started entering into races around the county.</p>

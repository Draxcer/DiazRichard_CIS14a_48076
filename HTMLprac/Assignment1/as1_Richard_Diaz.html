<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Richard Diaz. I am 20 years old. Have been interested in computer for as long as I can remember. Going to RCC to get an Associates in Computer Science: Programming. This is my last semester here. I will either be transfering to Cal State San Bernadino, or UCR. Along side school I also work part-time at a Chinese Restaurant as a busser. </p>
